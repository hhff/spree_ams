Spree AMS is a module namspaced under Spree's Api module, providing a Spree Application with a collection of routes that behave identically to the regular api routes, but instead respond with serialized models (via the [Active Model Serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) gem).

This gem does not modify Spree's existing API - it can be used alongside this gem.


Installation
------------

Add spree_ams to your Spree store's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_ams'
```

Install the Initializer:

```ruby
rails g spree:api:ams:install
```

Then run ```bundle``` and you're good to go!


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

Contributing
------------

Generate docs from the Acceptance Tests (you'll need to generate your dummy test_app first)!

```ruby
rake app:docs:generate
```
